# Simon-says-react  

Demo: https://simon-says-rhjje.netlify.app  

Simon Says is a game of memory and pattern recognition. The game starts by playing a random color, and waits for the player to copy that same color. Next, he adds another random color to the sequence, playing the whole sequence again, and waits for the player to do the same. The game's objective is to keep copying the random pattern, which becomes harder and harder as the sequences grows longer. The game terminates when the player fails one of the sequence's color!
